Your Lie in April (Opening: If it Shines)

2
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:27.000
A rainbow after the rain, and a flower that bloomed in the cold change colors abundantly.

3
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:39.300
That day, I fell in love with you who were looking up at the blazing red sky.

4
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:55.000
That dramatic film-like scenic instant won't disappear, since it's etched into my heart.

5
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:07.620
It was you, you who taught me that if the darkness shines, it will become a night of stars.

6
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:19.900
Don't hide your sadness behind a smile anymore, because all the twinkling stars will shine on you.
